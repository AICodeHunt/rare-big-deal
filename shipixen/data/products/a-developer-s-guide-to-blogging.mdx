Here are some of my most recent earnings from technical writing.Consider this real-time example:A Full-time technical writer/developer advocate/developer relations is getting on an average of $30-90k in Asia and 2-4x that in the US/EMEA. Most of these businesses do not want to spend their weeks writing content. Even if they manage to find a great person and get one good piece of content every week from them, that's $1k-$5k per technical blog. And maintaining similar volume/velocity/quality internally is difficult since the best technical employees get burned out soon from generating content and/or get pulled into other projects because no marketing team ever has enough technical people. This is where you can fill a gap in their backlog and become a good player from the outside &amp; it's a win win for both business and you as creator.
