  This bundle is made of all the books I have written about soccer betting. The individual purchase of these books would cost you €40. If you purchase the bundle you will save €15 which is a 37% discount on the full price. At the moment, I have written 3 titles, and I will add all the betting books I write in the future to this bundle.If you like, you can already purchase a lifetime subscription to all my present and future books. This will allow you to access all future books at a huge discount.PS: If you have already purchased some of my books, contact me and I will offer you a 50% discount on the lifetime subscription. These are the books in the bundle right now Code a Soccer Betting model in a weekendThis is the first book in the series. It is about building a successful model for betting on soccer matches, with a little code (we are going to use python).I will show you how to install the basic software, obtain historical data about matches, visualize data, build a model and test it. That's it.This is a short book. After reading it you will be able to use data to create predictions about the outcome of soccer matches according to a statistical model. You will be able to apply this knowledge straight away as part of a betting strategy. I estimate this book will take no longer than a weekend to read.You can read the first 3 Chapters of the book for free here.ContentsInstall pythonSet up a research notebookGet historical soccer dataVisualize data and find correlationsBuild a statistical modelTest your model on real dataBonus: Value Betting strategiesSoccer Betting CodingThis second book is more advanced. You already should have familiarity with coding in Python to be able to follow the code examples. This book is fairly short. The main aim is to show you how to translate a soccer betting model into predictions and an automated betting strategy. Once you have read this book you will be able to build your own model, test its profitability on past results, tune it to obtain the best returns and write an automation to highlight the matches with the highest expected value.ContentsPrinciple of building a soccer betting model (1X2, Over, Under, Corners markets)Model Back-testing: how to estimate the returns of your modelModel Tuning: adjust your model parameters to obtain the best returnsProbability and Odds: compare your model probabilities with odds and find value betsAutomation: get value bets without manual effortBuild a Soccer Betting model for Euro 2024This books has been written in order to show how to build a betting model and predict the results of the Euro 2024 tournament.It is related to the Summer 2024 matches but the principles outlined in the book can be applied to any International soccer competition.In this book we use data to build a model that can predict the outcome of all the matches played in the tournament.
